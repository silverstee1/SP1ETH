The two parts are meant to be snapped together without any hardware, print using something stronger than PLA, I used PLA+ as it was less brittle and prone to snapping unlike regular PLA.

v3.2 of the insert case piece has grippers added to the model to improve fitment with the SP1 metal retaining springs on the gamecube or a more stable/better.
